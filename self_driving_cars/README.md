# Self-Driving Cars

This simulation  is a simple implmentation of a linear and longitudinal model for a self-driving car. The simulation runs in a 2D space and the car is controlled by a PID controller. We use CARLA as the simulation environment. It's base on the [Self-Driving Cars Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars) from Coursera.

### Running the simulation
